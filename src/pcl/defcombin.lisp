;; Method Combination Types
;; ========================

;; #### NOTE: one could be tempted to put this in defs.lisp, alongside with
;; the METHOD-COMBINATION hierarchy, but it's preferable to keep it here for
;; the following reasons.
;; 1. defs.lisp has some limitations due to the fact that it's used during
;;    bootstrap (there is no :documentation option to DEFCLASS, I don't think
;;    VALIDATE-SUPERCLASS is available, etc.).
;; 2. the bootstrap code creates two (early) specific method combination
;;    objects (STANDARD and (OR :MOST-SPECIFIC-FIRST)) which are stored
;;    respectively in *STANDARD-METHOD-COMBINATION* and
;;    *OR-METHOD-COMBINATION*. These objects are created before the full
;;    method combination architecture is in place, but they're enough to
;;    bootstrap the whole thing. So we can leave them be until this file is
;;    loaded, and convert them to the final machinery eventually.
